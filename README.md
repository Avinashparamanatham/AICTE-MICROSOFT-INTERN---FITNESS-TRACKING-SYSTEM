# Fitness Tracking System

An advanced machine learning-based fitness tracking application that provides personalized health insights, predictive analytics, and comprehensive performance monitoring.

## Overview

The Fitness Tracking System addresses critical limitations in traditional fitness tracking solutions by implementing sophisticated machine learning algorithms, comprehensive data processing, and a user-friendly interface. The system generates accurate predictions for calorie expenditure and heart rate based on individual physiological characteristics, tracks performance over time, and enables personalized goal setting.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Predictive Analytics**: Uses Random Forest algorithms to generate personalized fitness metrics predictions
- **Comprehensive Health Monitoring**: Tracks multiple dimensions of fitness including calories burned, heart rate, and exercise duration
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Presents complex health data through intuitive, engaging visualizations
- **Personalized Goal Setting**: Enables users to set and track progress towards specific fitness objectives
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors fitness trends over time with detailed analytics
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlit-based web application with intuitive navigation and clear data presentation

## Technical Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture:

1. **Data Sources Layer**: Collects information from wearable devices, manual entries, and user profiles
2. **Data Processing Layer**: Implements preprocessing, feature engineering, and missing data handling
3. **Machine Learning Layer**: Applies Random Forest algorithms for predictive modeling
4. **Application Layer**: Delivers the Streamlit web interface with interactive visualizations
5. **User Presentation Layer**: Ensures an intuitive, engaging user experience

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fitness-tracking-system.git
cd fitness-tracking-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the data processor to generate machine learning models:
```bash
python fitness_data_processor.py
```

4. Launch the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

### Data Input

The system accepts the following user inputs:
- Age
- Height
- Weight
- Gender
- Exercise duration

### Prediction Center

Enter your physiological details and exercise parameters to receive personalized predictions for:
- Calories burned
- Heart rate

### Performance Tracking

View your fitness metrics over time through interactive charts that display:
- Calories burned
- Exercise duration
- Heart rate variations

### Goal Setting

Create personalized fitness goals by specifying:
- Goal type (Weight Loss, Muscle Gain, Endurance, Cardiovascular Health)
- Target value
- Time frame

## Data Processing and Model Training

The `FitnessDataProcessor` class handles:
- Loading and preprocessing fitness data
- Creating and training machine learning models
- Saving trained models for use in the web application

If actual dataset files are not available, the system generates realistic sample data for demonstration purposes.
